# Resemble AI MCP Server 

## Hi! The following is an implementation of an MCP server to access Resemble AI's resources. See the following videos of its uses:
This server was implemented using the Python SDK.

### **list_voices tool:**

### **generate_tts tool:**
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efa5a206-2463-46d3-8707-ccd7df71616d

## Usage and Installation:
Step 1: Clone the repository

Step 2: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

Step 3: Create a .env file and gather your Resemble API key from **https://app.resemble.ai/account/api**

Step 4: Configure your **claude_desktop_config.app** file by visiting Claude Desktop Settings.

Step 5: Quit Claude, and reopen the app. It should now be good to go if the hammer icon is visible <img width="42" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d305469-3fb0-4970-8965-79d852192c46" />

Step 6: If the hammer icon isn't showing up, check your config file, the server logs for debugging, ensure your server (virtual environment, interpreter, .env, general code, etc) is configured properly, or visit **https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging**.
